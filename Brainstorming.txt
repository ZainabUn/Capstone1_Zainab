Brainstorming

idea 1:
research for a bakery
Questions: 
Which item sells most in winter/spring/summer?
Which area in Chicago dine outs a lot
Which area has less bakeries in Chicago
Looking at competitors data like Dunkin donut
what item sells most


idea 2: non profit for ingredients
look at fig app
look at scan halal
look at organization for Ud , KD
get in touch with food scientist
