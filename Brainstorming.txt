Brainstorming

idea 1:
research for a bakery
Questions: 
Which item sells most in winter/spring/summer?
Which area in Chicago dine outs a lot
Which area has less bakeries in Chicago
Looking at competitors data like Dunkin donut
what item sells most
vegan/vegetarian/halal

https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-d&geo=US&q=halal&hl=en-US


Choose one idea to go forward with, and start defining the details around that business. What do
they do? Who are the customers? Who are the suppliers? What area of the market does the business
aim for?

WHY GOOD IDEA?
